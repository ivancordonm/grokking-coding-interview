# Reverse Nodes In Even Length Groups

Youâ€™re given a linked list. Your task is to reverse all of the nodes that are present in the groups with an even number
of nodes in them. The nodes in the linked list are sequentially assigned to non-empty groups whose lengths form the
sequence of the natural numbers (1,2,3,4,...). The length of a group is

* The 1<sup>st</sup>  node is assigned to the first group.
* The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> nodes is assigned to the second group.
* The 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> nodes is assigned to the third group and so on.
